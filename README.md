# Platform Engineer Guideline

The objective of a Platform Engineer is to abstract complexity and enable the delivery of products as quickly as possible. The responsibility is to build an ecosystem of tools that provides clear guidelines and frameworks, organizing the capabilities of developers and creators to build MVPs or full products with ease.

### Key Principles:

Automation and Standardization: Automation is critical for speeding up product delivery. Platform Engineers should prioritize automating the creation of development, testing, and production environments. Standardizing workflows ensures consistency, reducing the learning curve and minimizing manual errors.

### Efficient Abstraction:

By abstracting the underlying infrastructure, developers can focus on creating features rather than dealing with operational complexities. APIs, self-service tools, and CI/CD pipelines should provide clear, efficient interfaces that enable developers to operate independently.

### Scalability and Resilience:

As platforms grow, scalability and resilience must be built-in from the start. The guidelines and frameworks should help developers easily build scalable and resilient applications that can handle increasing loads and recover from failures with minimal impact.

### End-to-End Support:

The tools and frameworks should support the full development lifecycle, from MVP creation to the delivery of complete products. Transitioning between phases should be seamless, ensuring that teams can scale up their efforts without needing to re-architect or reinvent processes.

### Developer Experience and Empowerment:

The platform should enhance the developer experience by removing roadblocks and providing intuitive tools. This enables faster prototyping, iteration, and deployment, ensuring that teams can focus on innovation without worrying about infrastructure.
